<h2>If you are done with everything</h2>
First of all, good job! There are several approaches that you may take from here: 

- go, enjoy your day or study something else

- proceed in the manual (once you'll learn about loops, everything is going to be much more exciting!)

- try any of the exercises below

<h2>So, you want a challenge. Good.</h2>
Totally not mandatory, but absolutely fun. (Okay, this probably depends on your definition of fun.)

These are a little bit harder than what you've found in the manual so far, so don't get frustrated if it takes more time to get them right. Also, don't hesitate to ask for help if you're stuck!

<h3>Century from year</h3>
Write a function that computes the century, given the year.
The first century starts from year 1 and goes up to and including year 100, the second century spans from year 101 up to and including the year 200 and so on.

Some test cases:
The function should return 20 for 1905 and 17 for 1700.

<h3>Complementary DNA</h3>
Write a function that given a strand of DNA, computes the complementary sequence.

Hint: in a couple of weeks you'll be able to do this using loops. For now, explore some built-in functions, namely - maketrans, .replace() and re.sub(). Read the documentation for these and choose the one that sounds like the best tool to use for this task. If you get confused, just ask!

When you are done with that, you can also explore cases like:
- what happens if the input string contains characters that aren't letters (but numbers or weird stuff like #?!)? How do you deal with that?
- how do you deal with uppercase and lowercase characters?
- if the input string contains something other than the allowed characters (aka A, T, G or C), can you find a way to throw an error? 

<h3>Transcribing DNA</h3>
Write a function that given a DNA string, computes the transcribed RNA (which is formed by replacing all occurrences of "T" in the DNA to "U" in the RNA).

You can try exploring the cases mentioned in the previous exercise.
